# FAQ

## What is Bannerbear?

[Bannerbear](https://www.bannerbear.com) is an API-based service that allows developers to push data to a graphical template in order to generate variations of that template. In an app context this enables things like per-user image customization. In other contexts it might enable a level of design scale that previously wasn't achievable, e.g. generating ads for thousands of individual products.

## What is a template?

A template is a graphic design of text and images that Bannerbear can manipulate via API. Currently users on Bannerbear must design their own template, or use one of the few available public templates. You can add these templates to your project, edit them / remix them, and then start pushing in your data via API to generate images. Example templates below:

## What is this repo?

I want to grow the public library of Bannerbear templates by collecting interesting / useful use-cases and ideas here, and then add the final template to this repo. The templates in this repo will be available in the Bannerbear template library.

## How do I make a request?

[Create a template request](https://github.com/yongfook/bannerbear-template-library/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=template-request.md&title=New+template+suggestion%3A+%28your+idea+here%29) and we will take it from there!
